# Keeping Tabs

Have you ever opened too many tabs on your browser and felt overwhelmed, not knowing what to close? This is a common issue that has plagued users of the internet for years and a viable solution has yet to come.

Keeping Tabs is a Chrome Extension that looks to solve this problem by using an advanced algorithm to keep track of which tabs a user should close and closes it for them. If you are worried about losing important tabs forever, fret not because Keeping Tabs saves the closed tabs and logs them for you to view later. A Keeping Tabs user can change their settings based on how they want to close their tabs, whether it be time or topic based. Users can save and open up old sessions of tabs that they want to come back to. Keeping Tabs also has other features that are easy to use with its sleek and sexy design, just ask Ivan, a recovering tab-aholic:

"Keeping Tabs helped me transition out of being a hoarder of webpages. I did not realize I had a problem but once I started using Keeping Tabs, I started to understand my addiction and I am now able to use the internet like a regular person." - Ivan

If you are interested in changing your life for the better, Keeping Tabs is available to download in the Chrome Web Store in Extensions section for Free.99.
